# Recommendation for Online Retailers
	Our goal is to build a recommendation engine for their products. This system allows for the prediction of the rating or preference a user would give to an item. Through exploratory data analysis and using surprise package we will build  a suitable recommender system for the dataset. Appropriately matching customers to items that they may be more inclined to purchase would likely increase the frequency of purchases per customer and thereby increase revenue for the client.
	Recommender systems provide recommendations through collaborative filtering, content-based filtering or hybrid approaches. The dataset features would suggest that collaborative filtering would be ideal for our purposes utilizing the quantity purchased as a base for rating. Collaborative filtering approaches utilize  a userâ€™s past behavior as well as similar decisions made by other users to predict items that the user may also have interests in.  We will train and test various recommender systems to find one that is most suitable for this dataset application using surprise.
